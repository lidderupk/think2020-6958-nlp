# IBM Watson Natural Language Processing Services and Discovery in action 
## Think 2020 [6958]

Learn how to get started using IBM's award-winning insight engine, Watson Discovery, to analyze and query your documents in natural language. We will learn how to query Watson, and improve our results by using an annotation tool, Smart Document Understanding, to feed Watson data that is relevant to our business need. Explore other common techniques to derive more insights from your data - such as connecting Watson Discovery to a chatbot, and visualizing your data in a web UI. Attendees will also get an in-depth review of NLP services and learn the APIs.
